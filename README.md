AI-ML

This repository contains my Machine Learning (ML) study codes.
I created it while learning different ML algorithms and concepts.

-----------------------------------------

Contents:
- Jupyter notebooks with ML implementations
- Python scripts for practice
- Datasets used in experiments (if any)

-----------------------------------------

Topics I Have Practiced:
- Regression (Linear, Logistic)
- Classification (Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, KNN)
- Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical)
- Basic Neural Networks
- Data preprocessing and visualization

-----------------------------------------

How to Use:
1. Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/Achuzz2004/AI-ML.git
   cd AI-ML

2. Open any notebook or script to view the code
   jupyter notebook
   (or just open .py / .ipynb files in your editor)

-----------------------------------------

Purpose:
This repo is only for study and practice.
I keep adding new codes as I learn more in AI and ML.
